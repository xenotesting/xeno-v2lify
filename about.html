  <h1>About Xeno</h1>
  <p>
    Xeno began before Summer 2024, originally known as <strong>FixMyDoge</strong> using Doge Unblocker.
    In October 2024, the idea evolved into a full hub — not just for bypassing filters, but
    for sharing useful tools, games, emulators, and fun features.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UI started violet, shifted to a Discord-like blurple in November (peak Xeno), and then
    moved to pink during Quarter 4 as Doge Unblocker was removed and replaced by Utopia. With
    time, Seraph (a massive open-source game collection) was added. Utopia was eventually removed
    due to low usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in Summer 2025, Xeno is more streamlined and focused on <strong>Games, Emulators, and Built-in Features</strong>.
    You’re on the official Netlify version, with more surprises on the way.
