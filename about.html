    <h1>About Xeno v2.0</h1>
    <p>
      Xeno started before the summer of 2024 as a random idea. Editing officially began in October 2024 after the project
      was inspired out of nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was Xeno, it was called FixMyDoge. The site used Doge Unblocker and was focused on bypassing the school's networks.. Eventually,
      Xeno became more than that — a hub for game links, unblocker links, and other fun links.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UI started a nice violet/purple color and changed to a blurple Discord-like color in January 2025. That was peak Xeno, where most links
      stayed unblocked for weeks, sometimes a month or two if kinda lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Doge’s servers went down permanently, Utopia replaced our beloved Doge Unblocker. Utopia Links and Seraph Links were introduced during Quarter 4
      — Seraph being an open-source game library with 200+ games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in Summer 2025, Utopia has unfortunately left Xeno due to low usage. Xeno’s focus has shifted to <strong>games, emulators, and other built-in features</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might see some new features added soon — possibly even some JavaScript tools — but Xeno's spirit remains: very stupid and flexible.
