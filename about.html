    <h1>About Xeno v2.0</h1>
    <p>
      Xeno started before the summer of 2024 as a random idea. Editing officially began in October 2024 after the project
      was inspired out of nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was Xeno, it was called FixMyDoge. The site used Doge Unblocker and was focused on bypassing filters. Eventually,
      Xeno became more than that — a hub for games, tools, and other fun features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UI started violet and changed to a blurple Discord-like color in November 2024. That was peak Xeno, where most links
      stayed unblocked for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Doge’s servers went down permanently, Utopia took over. Utopia Links and Seraph Links were introduced during Quarter 4
      — Seraph being an open-source game library with 200+ games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in summer 2025, Utopia has been phased out due to low usage. Xeno’s focus has shifted to <strong>Games, Emulators, and Built-in Features</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might see some new features added soon — possibly even some JavaScript tools — but Xeno's spirit remains: fun, flexible, and refreshingly random.
